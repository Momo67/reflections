What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A new directory named .git is created. I need to do this to create the environment for tracking my files

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area only contains the files which I want to commit. It separate what I want to keep trace changes of.
