When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to share my work with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I sometimes don't want have the changes to my files made by others 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a copy of a repository in GitHub, a clone is a local copy of a repository from GitHub or local and a branch is a local version of a repository for by example test of a new functionnality that would be implemented later.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
To have in local the modifications made remotely

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
In clearly separating each files a single person is working on. There would be no conflicts, but much harder to synchronize.
